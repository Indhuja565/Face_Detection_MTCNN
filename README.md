This project implements a Face Detection system using the Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network (MTCNN). The model is designed to accurately detect human faces under varying lighting conditions, poses, and occlusions.

Features:
  Detects multiple faces in an image with bounding boxes.
  Identifies facial landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth).
  Handles different poses, lighting conditions, and partial occlusions.
